Simon project for CS 260

I learned that you can change colors through the bootstrap. I feel like I shouldn't have done it that way and have done it through my main.css

I also am learning to better take a close look and a far look. One thing that happened to me was that I didn't link my main.css file and for 20 min I was trying to figure out what was wrong.

I learned that once you get certain things coded, you can do a lot of copying and pasting. In this project, I could copy and paste my toolbar (at the top of the page) to every .html file.
